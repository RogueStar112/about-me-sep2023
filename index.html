            I am 24 years old, and I enjoy taking walks and listening to
            music!<br />
            I can be quite talkative, and get overwhelmed at times, but I do
            what I can!<br />
            I'm surrounded by gadgets. Feel free to click on parts of my face to
            find out more about each gadget! (WIP)

            I have done GCSEs and A-Levels. Though, I don't have very fond
            experiences of education. It's not the end of the world for my poor
            grades.

        <h2>Job Experience</h2>

        <p>
          I have initially started volunteering in Mind, a mental health
          charity. This was before COVID.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, I worked at Domino's Pizza for 3 gruelling years. After getting
          burnt out from this job, I decided it was best for me to find a job I
          could do at the comfort of my own home, such as web development.
